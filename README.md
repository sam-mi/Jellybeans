# Jellybean Competition

> A guessing competition using Ethereum

The aim of this competition is to use the 'jellybean' problem to explore Ethereum, smart contracts and dapp frontends


### Overview

* Anyone can create a competition by uploading an image that shows a known quantity of uncountable things.
* The competition has a base entry value - how much it costs to place an initial bet
* Each subsequent bet is either disallowed or increases in costs
* A Competition has an end date
* Winners are revealed at the end date and winnings distributed
* If there multiple winners, the pot is divided amongst them equally. 
* If there are no winners, the pot goes to the developers.
* A jackpot winner is determined by a winner guessing the exact number
* A winner is determined by the closest guess (without going over?) if there is no Jackpot winner.

### Phase 1

* Developers create the competition, no image upload
* Simple bet cost setting
* One address one bet
* First bet after the end date triggers the end of the competition
